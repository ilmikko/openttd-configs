# openttd-configs

Example configs for OpenTTD.

Confirmed working with OpenTTD v14.1.

Somehow, server passwords were not working until putting them in a separate `secrets.cfg`; putting them in either `private.cfg` or `openttd.cfg` would not have the password and keep the server open for everybody.

Note that some settings are changed, for example town names are in Finnish. I think it's better this way.
